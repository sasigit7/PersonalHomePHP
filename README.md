All About My PHP Learning Journey Along With Some Cool Projects.  


## First of all, I successfully completed a Web Development Experience Program under a Senior Web Developer who assigned me around 46 Real Time tasks over the course of three months. 
### This program provided me an opportunity to work with a Web and Mobile App Development Company <a href="http://bunebear.com/">Bunebear</a>. At Bune Bear, I was able to successfully assist their team in writing efficient code using a variety of programming languages, including 
<ul>
  <li>Researching different software programs and becoming familiar with their use.</li>
  <li>Writing efficient code using HTML/CSS/PHP/MYSQL.</li>
  <li>Building web pages and web applications that are used across multiple products.</li>
  <li>Maintaining, enhancing and expanding websites as needed.</li>
</ul>
