/* In this PHP exercise, you will put all the loops through their paces. Write a script using first a while loop, then a do while loop, then two for loops. The script will output the following to the browser:

abc abc abc abc abc abc abc abc abc

xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Item A
Item B
Item C
Item D
Item E
Item F
Create the 'abc' row with a while loop, the 'xyz' row with a do while loop, and the last two sections with for loops. Remember to include HTML and source code line breaks in your output. No arrays allowed in this solution. */
